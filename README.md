# Project Background

ACME Health Insurance, established in 2013, is a commercial provider offering a variety of health plans to individuals and families. The company operates on a fee-for-service model, paying healthcare providers a set fee for each service rendered to policyholders.

This project analyzes data on beneficiaries currently enrolled in the insurance plan, with features indicating patient characteristics and total medical expenses charged for the year. The goal is to thoroughly analyze and synthesize this data to uncover actionable insights that improve ACME Health Insuranceâ€™s operations.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Category 1:** Demographic factors: Exploring how demographic factors (age, sex, and region) influence the total medical expenses charged to the insurance plan.
- **Category 2:** Lifestyle Factors: Analyzing the impact of lifestyle factors, such as BMI and smoking status on total medical expenses charged to the plan for the calendar year.
- **Category 3:** Familial status: An analysis examining how the number of dependents (children) covered under the insurance plan affects an individual's total medical expenses.

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
