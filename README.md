# Project Background

ACME Health Insurance, established in 2013, is a commercial provider offering a variety of health plans to individuals and families. The company operates on a fee-for-service model, paying healthcare providers a set fee for each service rendered to policyholders.

This project analyzes data on beneficiaries currently enrolled in the insurance plan, with features indicating patient characteristics and total medical expenses charged for the year. The goal is to thoroughly analyze and synthesize this data to uncover actionable insights that improve ACME Health Insuranceâ€™s operations.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Category 1:** Demographic factors: Exploring how demographic factors (age, sex, and region) influence the total medical expenses charged to the insurance plan.
- **Category 2:** Lifestyle Factors: Analyzing the impact of lifestyle factors, such as BMI and smoking status on total medical expenses charged to the plan for the calendar year.
- **Category 3:** Familial status: An analysis examining how the number of dependents (children) covered under the insurance plan affects an individual's total medical expenses.

* **Main insight 2.** Males generally have 10% to 15% higher average expenses than females: Across most age groups and regions, males tend to have higher insurance charges, suggesting a consistent gender gap in healthcare costs.
  
* **Main insight 3.** Northeast and Southeast regions have expenses 5% to 10% higher than Northwest and Southwest: These regions tend to have higher average charges, indicating a regional disparity in healthcare costs. Southwest region has expenses approximately 5% lower than other regions: This region consistently shows lower average charges, suggesting a more cost-effective healthcare environment.

* **Main insight 1.** Smokers have significantly higher expenses: Smokers face insurance charges that are approximately 3.78 times higher than those for non-smokers. This highlights the substantial impact of smoking on healthcare costs.
  
* **Main insight 2.** Obesity is linked to higher expenses: Individuals with obesity have insurance charges that are 48% higher than those with a normal BMI. This suggests a strong correlation between weight and healthcare costs.
Underweight individuals have lower expenses: Compared to the normal BMI group, individuals who are underweight have 5% lower insurance charges.
  
* **Main insight 3.** Smokers have a much higher average expense: The highest average charge is associated with smokers, while the lowest is for underweight individuals.
